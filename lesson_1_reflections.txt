How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped narrow down the lines that were changed only.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily go back in time and see where changes were made. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A software project is always a working progress. You don't want to save until you 
    have a completed version of the task you're working on. 
    However, not autosaving your work could lead to losses. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Most software project are made up of multiple files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will list all the commits made. Then I can use git diff (the commit I want) (previous commit)
    to see the changes made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'm more likely to try bold things and be brave.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To organize all projects I've worked on.
    Have a public profile for employers and anyone else who would like to see my work.
    Contribute to open source projects.
    Learn about new projects and developments.
