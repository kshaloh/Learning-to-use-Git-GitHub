When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	A remote repository is very useful if I'm going to be working from different 
    	machines or with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Sometimes I may not want to include some of the changes made remotely on
    	my local machine where my main project lives. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Fork: The ability to clone someone else's project from thier GitHub account 
		to mine.
		This is useful if I want to build on an existing project and/or
		take it in a new direction.
	Clone: The ability to copy an existing project to my local machine or Github 
		account.
		Same as forking with the addition of cloning to my local machine.
	Branch: The ability to take a project in a new direction without disrupting the 
		original direction. 
		A fork is essentially a branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
